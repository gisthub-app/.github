GitHub gists are broken. 

When a user creates a gist on GitHub, they are prompted to choose to make their gist a **secret.** While most people think that a **secret gist** is identical to a private repo, the reality is that it‚Äôs not. Anyone on the internet can access your ‚Äúsecret gist‚Äù if they have the URL. Put simply, secret gists are *unlisted* on your profile and can only be accessible by you and others who have the URL to the gist. Users have been raising complaints about [the "secret" gist functionalities on GitHub forums.](https://github.community/t/make-public-gists-private/196652)

Now think about this scenario, you‚Äôre a Software Engineer in a biigggg tech company and you share an important gist containing some important script with a colleague. Now we all know the retention rate in the tech industry. A couple of months later, your colleague leaves the company but still has access to all the proprietary gists. He/she may knowingly or unknowingly use code from that snippet in their future workplace.
This is not good. We are here to do good. Which is why we created GistHub.

GistHub solves for the lack of "private" gists on GitHub and adds additional features in order to make creating and sharing gists a lucrative experience.
